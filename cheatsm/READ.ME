The Kaggle Cover Type challenge is a blast.

But hitting that 100% mark? Brutal. Most students are stuck around 80% accuracy, our squad pushed it to a solid 90%.

So… I’m declaring war on the challenge.

Now it’s Plan B. The ultimate flex.

The dark side.

The true cheating.

Back to coding. 
That was much easier than I thought. + New column + index n+1 
Finish

As simple and fun
